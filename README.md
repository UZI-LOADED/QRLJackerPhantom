# QRLJacker Phantom Edition
⚙️ STEP 1: Run the Setup
Right-click run.bat

Select “Run as administrator”

🪄 This will:

Launch the PhantomBot Command Center

Begin automatic setup if not yet initialized

Create any missing folders/files

(In next updates: launch GUI)

💬 If you see a terminal open with a PhantomBot > prompt — you’re in!

⚙️ STEP 2: Install Requirements (if not done already)
If the Phantom does not auto-install dependencies:

Open a terminal manually:
Press Windows + R, type cmd, hit Enter

Navigate to the folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Path\To\QRLJackerPhantom
Install required Python packages:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
That command ensures:

Flask for hosting

PyQt5 (GUI)

requests, pyngrok, and speech_recognition for voice & automation

⚙️ STEP 3: Launch PhantomBot
From inside the same folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
python phantom_bot/phantom.py
Or you can trigger with:

bash
Copy
Edit
run.bat
You should now see:

bash
Copy
Edit
